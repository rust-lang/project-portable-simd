Welcome to the repository for the Portable SIMD Project Group! This is the
repository we use to organise our work. Please refer to our [charter] for
more information on our goals and current scope.

## Current Status

We're currently working on an initial `std::simd` implementation over in the [stdsimd][`std::simd`] repo.

## How Can I Get Involved?

[You can find a list of the current members available
on `rust-lang/team`.][team-toml]

The best place to start is looking at [open issues in stdsimd][stdsimd-issues]

We also participate on [Zulip][chat-link], feel free to introduce
yourself over there and ask us any questions you have.

Group meetings happen every week via [Zulip][chat-link].
You can find them on the [Libs team calendar][calendar]!
