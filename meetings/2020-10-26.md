## Agenda

## Outcomes

- Try kick off a MCP in `T-compiler` for portable SIMD intrinsics in `rustc` to abstract us from a future Cranelift backend.

## Summary

### What's blocking us from `nightly`?

- **Cranelift:** Try kick off a MCP in `T-compiler` for portable SIMD intrinsics in `rustc` to abstract us from a future Cranelift backend.
- **riscv64gc:** Still generating invalid code for `riscv64gc`, but we're not sure if it's actually an issue with that target or not. It needs some more investigation work. So far we've just been checking it using `cargo cross`.

### Floating points

- Floating points are a bit of a mess and Portable SIMD is exposed to all of it. It looks like there's a separate project in nailing down our floating point story in Rust.
- We should also figure out what Portable SIMD needs at a minimum as a foundation for its API.
